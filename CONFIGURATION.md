# Configuration 
To use this repo in the osgi GitHub account, there are two changes and a check:

- change the baseurl in `_config.yml` to the project name (you just have to remove ".gh-pages")

	`baseurl: "/osgi.enroute.site"`

- add the CNAME file to the root directory
- make sure the Disqus config is correct on the forum page

Lastly, I was using GitHub's desktop git tool for the work and it doesn't have a signature setting. I'll sign anything that needs signing if you'll just tell me how. If this helps or suffices, it applies to the entire repository:
