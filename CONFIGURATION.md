# Configuration 
To use this repo in the osgi GitHub account, there are two changes and a check:

- change the baseurl in `_config.yml` to the project name (you just have to remove ".gh-pages")

	`baseurl: "/osgi.enroute.site"`

- add the CNAME file to the root directory
- make sure the Disqus config is correct on the forum page
